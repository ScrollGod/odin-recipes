        <h4>Take a dip into this glorious stuffed sandwich this summer!</h4>
        <p>When I was a kid, we often spent all day at the community pool. We'd leisurely snack on popsicles and chips, until it was time for lunch. No one wanted to dry off, get dressed, and go home for lunch. Mayonnaise didn’t travel well and wasn’t safe under the summer sun. Peanut butter sandwiches were a solution, but also suffered under the heat. </p>
        <p>My kids love the pool too, so I looked for a better alternative to those less-than lunches of childhood. The answer? Stuffed sandwiches. They travel well and are easy to eat, even with wet pool fingers. Prepping the night before or in the morning is easy with a round loaf filled with sandwich fixings. A bake-on mustard and butter coating adds extra flavor.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 round bread loaf</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sliced deli ham</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sliced deli turkey</li>
            <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>6 slices Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li> Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you're making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top.</li>
            <li> Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to make croutons, so there's no waste.</li>
            <li> Melt butter with mustard in the mircrowave for 15 seconds in a small bowl. Mix well.</li>
            <li> Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf top;place loaf and top on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool. </li>        
            <li> Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the hollowed-out loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of ham and turkey. Repeat until the loaf is full. Top with reserved bread top.</li>
            <li> Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top with something to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
            <li> Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular sections.</li>
